    "The core building block of neural networks is the \"layer\", a data-processing module which you can conceive as a \"filter\" for data. Some data comes in, and comes out in a more useful form. Precisely, layers extract representations out of the data fed into them -- hopefully representations that are more meaningful for the problem at hand. Most of deep learning really consists of chaining together simple layers which will implement a form of progressive \"data distillation\". A deep learning model is like a sieve for data processing, made of a succession of increasingly refined data filters -- the \"layers\".\n",
    "Here our network consists of a sequence of two Dense layers, which are densely-connected (also called \"fully-connected\") neural layers. The second (and last) layer is a 10-way \"softmax\" layer, which means it will return an array of 10 probability scores (summing to 1). Each score will be the probability that the current digit image belongs to one of our 10 digit classes.\n",
    "To make our network ready for training, we need to pick three more things, as part of \"compilation\" step:\n",
    "A loss function: the is how the network will be able to measure how good a job it is doing on its training data, and thus how it will be able to steer itself in the right direction.\n",
    "An optimizer: this is the mechanism through which the network will update itself based on the data it sees and its loss function.\n",
    "Metrics to monitor during training and testing. Here we will only care about accuracy (the fraction of the images that were correctly classified).\n",
    "The exact purpose of the loss function and the optimizer will be made clear throughout the next two chapters."
